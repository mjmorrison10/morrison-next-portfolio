It looks dated, so modernize it. 

Clear heirachy between elements

Images look cheap

Differentiate the CTA button from other buttons

Maybe display projects more prominently

Update Testimonials bug. (Have to double click to open on mobile)

I didn't wanna be the one to say it lol, not that I could design a better one. Reminds me of old websites with scrolling text banner ads everywhere
If it converts then it converts though, hopefully it does because it was definitely a lot of work


1. Choose specific colours & don't "overdo" it with the colour combinations (you could combine dark blue with orange for contrast with white, light blue / black, when needed on the text. Never choose similar colour tones  for bgr / text. Text should always be readable). 2. Text's sizes are too big, in general. Minimise them a little. 3. Place your photos / text on a specific direction each time, so that you "guide" your user & make your site's navigation better. When a site is not readable / easy to navigate, "clicks" are lost = "less sales". Overall, try to "remove the noise", adjust the needed information & then continue "adding stuff", accordingly.
